		        <h2>Introduction
		        <p>"Basketball is a popular team sport that is played by two teams of five players each. The game is played on a rectangular court, with each team trying to score points by shooting <b>a ball through a hoop that is mounted 10 feet (3.048 meters) high on a backboard at each end of the court.</b>

The objective of the game is to score more points than the opposing team by shooting the ball through the hoop. The ball is advanced up the court by dribbling or passing the ball between teammates. Once a <b>player has possession of the ball, they can either take a shot at the basket or pass the ball to a teammate.</b>
The game is divided into four quarters, each lasting 12 minutes in professional games. The team with the most points at the end of the fourth quarter wins the game. If the score is tied at the end of regulation <b>time, the game goes into overtime, with additional periods of play until a winner is determined.</b> 
Basketball is played at all levels, from recreational games at local parks to professional leagues around the world. The most famous professional league is the National Basketball Association (NBA) in the United States, which is home to some of the world's best players."
